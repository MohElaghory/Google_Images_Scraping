# Images Downloader From Google

### We search in Google Images for anything we want to download, so in this script. We search for a giraffes, for example, and then we scrape all the images in a folder we called it the same name as the thing we are looking for, so here I will name the folder with giraffes.

#### and in every time we scroll down the website to download all searched images.
